    <h1 style ="color:white;">Last time I checked, there were actual cookies :  My Personal Story of Cookie Monster.</h1>
    
    <p style ="color:white;">Cookies, Cookies, and More Cookies. There was a time where I was obsessed with <strong>COOKIES</strong> at a very young age until I learned about 
    the cookie monster. A blue puppet like creature with lifeless eyes staring into your deepest secrets. 
    (Click,if you dare) <a href = https://www.britannica.com/topic/Cookie-Monster>Cookie Monster</a> 
    Children will immediately recognize this puppet from the show Sesame Street and from our childhood we learn that Cookie Monster loves <strong> COOKIES </strong>. He is often
    the beloved puppet children love for his funny looks and obsession to cookies. However, it wasn't the same for me, as I despised this character because I always envied him eating
    cookies constantly. Cookies were my favorite snack growing up and I would find multiples ways of sneaking a cookie before bedtime. In the show, there were great segments 
    with count dracula, Elmo, and Big bird. And as Cookie Monster scene come up, I feel built up anger, as he eats the cookies or I would call it crumbling and smashing the cookies
    into pieces. It infuriates me watching the cookie monster waste amazing cookies to the ground. &#x1F621; I've never watched Sesame Street ever again. </p>
